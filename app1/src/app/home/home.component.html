      A hospital is a healthcare institution that provides medical treatment to people who are ill or injured.
      Hospitals are staffed by trained healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and other support
      staff. Hospitals typically offer a range of medical services, including diagnostic tests, surgery, and
      specialized treatments for various health conditions. In addition to treating patients, hospitals also
      conduct research and provide education and training for medical professionals. Hospitals can vary in
      size and specialization, with some focused on specific areas of medicine, such as pediatric care or
      cancer treatment. Overall, hospitals play a crucial role in promoting public health and providing
      essential medical care to those in need.
